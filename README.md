# Codeforces-ProblemFinderBot

The bot searches problems on codeforces that are unsolved by a set of users and of given problem ratings.
To create mashup for virtual participation in group we need problems that are of given rating and unsolved by all who are participating in the contest and this bot automates the cumbersome part of finding problems.

# SETUP
1.Run it using this command:

python3 app.py
2.Enter usernames separated by space.

3.Enter the problem ratings separated by space.

The bot will then take some time to process and will show results in terminal int the format:

rating: link to problem
